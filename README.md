# Fitness Application

###  Improve your gains
This application serves as an fitness hub for users. Whether you are:

- a new gym goer
- an experienced gym rat
- currently regretting wasting money on that gym membership in January
- making excuses for not going to the gym (possibly me)

There is something for everyone. For example, it might be difficult sometimes especially for new gym goers to
build a balanced or consistent schedule. Or, one might be doing the same *boring* schedule
continuously and dreading going to the gym, but lazy enough to not want to spend time reorganizing their workout,
including myself.

The application will allow you to make your **own personal profile** by entering basic information such as your name,
age, gender, and weight. For each profile, you can enter exercises with a number of sets,
repetitions, time per set, muscle groups worked, and a personal difficulty rating. 
You can view saved exercises by various filters, and edit them.
You will also be able to generate a workout schedule with your list of exercises. 
These workouts can be named and saved.
