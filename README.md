# MeFit

###  Improve your gains today
This application serves as a fitness hub for users. Whether you are:

- a new gym goer
- an experienced gym rat
- currently regretting wasting money on that gym membership in January
- making excuses for not going to the gym (possibly me)

There is something for everyone. For example, it might be difficult sometimes especially for new gym goers to
build a balanced or consistent schedule. Or, one might be doing the same *boring* schedule
continuously and dreading going to the gym, but lazy enough to not want to spend time reorganizing their workout,
including myself.

The application will allow you to make your **own personal profile** by entering basic information such as your name,
age, gender, and weight. For each profile, you can enter exercises with a number of sets,
repetitions, time per set, muscle groups worked, and a personal difficulty rating. 
You can view saved exercises by various filters, and edit them.
A unique feature of this application is the ability to generate a random workout schedule 
given certain parameters. These workouts can also be named and saved.

Event logging classes and their tests were derived from AlarmSystem from CPSC 210.

Inspiration for the console application was taken from TellerApp and JsonSerializationDemo from CPSC 210.

Additional inspiration and references for the GUI is from:
